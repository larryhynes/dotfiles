"/* vim: set filetype=vim : */

" This is all based on the sample vifmrc that ships with vifm
" http://vifm.sourceforge.net/

" This is the actual command used to start vi.  The default is vim.
" If you would like to use another vi clone such Elvis or Vile
" you will need to change this setting.
set vicmd=/usr/local/bin/vim

" Trash Directory
" The default is to move files that are deleted with dd or :d to
" the trash directory.  If you change this you will not be able to move
" files by deleting them and then using p to put the file in the new location.
" I recommend not changing this until you are familiar with vifm.
" This probably shouldn't be an option.
